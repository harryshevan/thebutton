"Thebutton" is an interactive quest to test basic software developers skills debugging web app.


Core idea: the main app is web site. The UI presents single round button in the middle of the screen.
The button is clickable. There is a form under the button. The button sends GET http request with text that is entered into form.
The user should guess what to enter in that form. How he should guess? The incorrect requests should return the answer in response as JWT.
The JWT public part should contain the codeword.


Stack: next.js + SSR

App pages:
1) main page with red button, white background and form
2) quest complete page with yellow background and fancy emoji fullscreen
